    <p>
      This is my first webpage. I am glad to create my first webpage. My name is
      Chibuzor Kennedy, I am a student of CapacityBay Orange group Cohort 3. I
      am interested in anything computer programming. These includes both
      frontend and backend. I love to watch the magic performed by the computer.
      It is always fascinating to behold. I will want to be at the forefront of
      solving the major problems affecting our society. I am currently learning
      the fundamentals of the web, which include: html, css, and javascript. I
      can't wait to have a good grasp of these technologies to enable me build
      stuffs. Specifically, I would love to solve problems reltated to academics
      in Africa, starting from my home country, Nigeria. This is my first
